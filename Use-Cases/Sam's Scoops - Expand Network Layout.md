# Case Study

Sam is excited about the pace at which the ice cream business has recently been growing. Of course, the technology needs are growing too. Sam just hired a shop manager and an additional counter attendant to cope with the increase in demand. Sam wants employees to access the network from anywhere in the shop, not just wired network points in the office. The new staff is supplied with mobile devices to connect to the network wirelessly.

You are tasked to advise Sam on the additional technology she needs and implement it once purchased. You need to update the previous physical diagram and expand it to include the new devices that will be installed. 

# Step 1: Identify additional equipment needs 

Task: Begin by making a list of all the additional equipment needed to expand Sam’s business to support the need presented in the case study. Keep in mind what device/s will allow additional staff to join the network and work wirelessly.

Answer: 

1. The already bought 2 mobile devices
2. Wireless Router for network connectivity for the mobile devices
3. Physical connection between Wireless Router and Switch

# Step 2: Construct a diagram

Task: Once you’ve identified the equipment needs, it’s time to demonstrate how everything works together. Using a mind-mapping tool (or pen and paper if you prefer), expand the network topology from the exercise in Week 1, Lesson 2.

Answer:

# Step 3: Identity and list protocols 

Task: With the expanded network topology in place, identify and list the two protocols that support the network at the network access layer of the TCP/IP suite to improve communication between employees.

Answer:

1. Wifi for the mobile devices
2. Ethernet for the cable-connected computers
