# Case Study

Sam is excited about the pace at which the ice cream business has recently been growing. Of course, the technology needs are growing too. Sam just hired a shop manager and an additional counter attendant to cope with the increase in demand. Sam wants employees to access the network from anywhere in the shop, not just wired network points in the office. The new staff is supplied with mobile devices to connect to the network wirelessly.

You are tasked to advise Sam on the additional technology she needs and implement it once purchased. You need to update the previous physical diagram and expand it to include the new devices that will be installed. 

# Step 1: Identify additional equipment needs
