# Case Study

Sam's Scoops currently operates out of a physical store in the local area. The business has grown in recent months, and Sam wants to expand her reach by selling ice cream online. However, her existing IT infrastructure is limited and not equipped to handle online sales. Sam needs a solution that can help her manage online sales and inventory while also providing her with the flexibility to scale the business in the future.

Currently, the business manages its inventory, sales, and customer data through an on-premise system that requires significant investment in hardware and software. The system is also prone to downtime, which can lead to a loss of revenue and customer trust. The business needs a solution that can scale with its growth and provide reliable access to data.

# Step 1: Review the challenges

Task: Identify and review the challenges mentioned in the case study to understand Sam's current IT infrastructure limitations, the need to manage online sales and inventory, and the requirement for a solution that can scale with the business growth.

Answer: 
1. Accessability: With all infrastructure on-premise, all business processes like inventory, sales, and customer data is only accessable from the store itself.
2. Availability/Reliability: As describes by the case study, the system has significant downtime, not only resulting in a waste of workforce, but also in a loss of revenue and customer trust
3. Costs: the upfront costs of the on-premise solution can put a big strain on the financial capabilities of a small business, limiting potential investments in actual business growth
4. Scalability: The fixed nature of the computational power of bought hardware either limits the potential growth of the business or requires constant additional investments in more hardware.
5. Security: Due to everything being stored in only one network or even device, the threat of data loss in form of hardware malfunctions, theft after a break-in, or an online attack is substantial.

# Step 2: Identify solutions

Task: Brainstorm at least two possible cloud solutions that Sam can implement to address her business challenges. 

Answer:
1. Cloud Point of Sale - Solution
The capabilities of different cloud solutions for managing inventory, customer data and more via a Point of Sale - Solution would enable Sam to collect all information in one place and even analyze this data for additional insights.

2. Cloud Storage & Backup
With storing data in the cloud, data loss is far less likely to occur due to hardware issues or a break-in. A backup additionally protects Sam against data loss after a digital attack.
