# Case Study

Sam started an ice cream business from home, relying on her personal devices to keep track of her recipes and taking orders from friends and family.â€¯Despite the modest beginnings, Sam's ice cream soon gained a following in the local community, and she opened a storefront to meet the growing demand. Once the store is open, Sam hires one additional employee to help her. To facilitate the running of the business, she needs to set up the office to allow two employees to oversee the company's activities. These activities include: stock keeping, printing out menus and promotional materials, and keeping financial records. Sam has purchased a network switch, but she needs your advice about the additional infrastructure required and the network that needs to be set up to make it possible to conduct her business.
